                    multidisciplinary branch of
                    engineering that focuses on the engineering of both electrical and mechanical systems, and also
                    includes a combination of robotics, electronics, computer, telecommunications, systems, control, and
                    product engineering. As technology advances over time, various subfields of engineering have
                    succeeded in both adapting and multiplying. The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design
                    solution that unifies each of these various subfields. Originally, the field of mechatronics was
                    intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics and electronics, hence the name being a
                    portmanteau of mechanics and electronics; however, as the complexity of technical systems continued
                    to evolve, the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">IoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components
                            associated with the Internet of Things will be essentially mechatronic. The development of
                            the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators to
                            research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and
                            manufactured. This allows them to face up to new issues such as data security, machine
                            ethics and the human-machine interface.

                                components. The term was coined in 1969 by engineer Tetsuro Mori to describe the synergy
                                that exists between electrical control systems and the mechanical machines they
                                regulate. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened to include the integration
                                of multiple other disciplines, including computer engineering, systems engineering and
